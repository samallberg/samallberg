One thing Iâ€™ve been able to boast since I was young is my ability to communicate in both verbal and written methods. 
I have a passion for things that are organized and precise - from my time to the tasks that I perform, and a hunger to learn more and succeed in any position I sit in. 
I bring with me these passions, as well as a strong set of core values focused around the protection of people and their privacy. 
These core values have brought me to the world of cybersecurity, where I have sown the garden of my dedication and devotion. 
This combination of skills, values, and interests have built the foundation you need to build the fortress of your security department.
